# taskctl CLI

`taskctl` emits JSON. Add `--json` when making the output contract explicit.

## Terminology: local companion

**Companion** here is a product term for the **device-local loopback HTTP service** that `taskctl` talks to in cloud mode. It applies Basic Authentication, stores device-only project path mappings, and keeps Codex/Git/Skill/MCP capabilities on the machine. It is not a chat persona and not a separate public “companion product API”.

| English | Prefer in Chinese | Do not use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local companion / loopback companion | 本地 companion、本地配套服务、环回代理 | 伴侣、伴侣 API |
| Taskboard HTTP API (`/api/tasks`, `/api/comments`, `/api/attachments`, …) | Taskboard HTTP API、本地服务 API、附件上传接口 | companion API、伴侣 API |

Env and files that refer to this service: `CODEX_TASKBOARD_COMPANION_URL`, `CODEX_TASKBOARD_URL` (loopback origin), `.data/cloud-companion.json`. Error code `LOCAL_COMPANION_REQUIRED` means a capability needs that **local loopback service**, not a different API surface.

## Context and projects

```bash
taskctl context current [--cwd PATH] [--json]
taskctl project list [--json]
taskctl project create --name NAME [--id ID] [--workspace-path PATH] [--json]
taskctl project map PROJECT_ID --workspace-path PATH [--json]
```

Use `--workspace-path` to associate a project with a local repository. `context current` chooses the most specific project whose workspace contains the current directory, then falls back to the `local` project.

Set `CODEX_TASKBOARD_URL` to override the default local API origin, `http://127.0.0.1:47823`.

For a shared cloud board, keep `taskctl` pointed at the **loopback companion** (local loopback service; see Terminology above) and configure the upstream HTTPS origin through it:

```bash
taskctl cloud login --url HTTPS_ORIGIN --actor-name NAME [--json]
taskctl cloud status [--json]
taskctl project list [--json]
taskctl project map PROJECT_ID --workspace-path /absolute/local/path [--json]
taskctl cloud logout [--json]
```

`cloud login` reads the member's password from a private `Account password:` prompt. Pass the member's exact account username to `--actor-name`; the Worker returns the verified identity and a revocable access token. The local companion stores the token—not the password—with mode `0600`; project mappings stay on the current device and can differ between collaborators. In cloud mode, failed upstream writes fail rather than falling back to or double-writing the local SQLite database.

Every issue or comment write must be attributed to a Codex conversation. In Codex, `taskctl` reads the current conversation from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`. Outside Codex, pass `--thread-id ID` explicitly. An explicit option takes precedence over the environment. Read commands do not require a conversation id.

Every successful command writes one JSON object with `schemaVersion` to stdout. The current schema version is `2`. Errors write one JSON object to stderr. Exit codes are `0` for success, `2` for invalid input, `3` when the service is unavailable, `4` for API or response errors, and `5` for conflicts.

## Read issues

```bash
taskctl issue list [--project PROJECT_ID] [--status STATUS] [--archived true|false|all] [--json]
taskctl issue get ID [--json]
```

## Create issues

```bash
taskctl issue create \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --title TITLE \
  [--description TEXT | --description-file FILE] \
  [--status STATUS] \
  [--priority PRIORITY] \
  [--labels a,b] \
  [--thread-id ID] \
  [--git-branch BRANCH] \
  [--worktree-path PATH] \
  [--worktree-branch BRANCH] \
  [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] \
  [--due-date YYYY-MM-DD] \
  [--recurrence-interval N --recurrence-unit day|week|month|year] \
  [--json]
```

Statuses are `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `blocked`, `done`, and `canceled`. Priorities are `none`, `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, and `low`.

Issues created through `taskctl` are assigned to Codex Agent by default. Other CLI writes preserve the existing assignee.

## Update issues

Read the issue immediately before a write and pass its `version` with `--if-version`.

```bash
taskctl issue update ID \
  [--project PROJECT_ID] \
  [--title TITLE] \
  [--description TEXT | --description-file FILE] \
  [--status STATUS] \
  [--priority PRIORITY] \
  [--labels a,b] \
  [--thread-id ID] \
  [--git-branch BRANCH] \
  [--worktree-path PATH] \
  [--worktree-branch BRANCH] \
  [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] \
  [--due-date YYYY-MM-DD] \
  [--recurrence-interval N --recurrence-unit day|week|month|year] \
  [--if-version N] \
  [--json]

taskctl issue move ID --status STATUS [--thread-id ID] [--if-version N] [--json]
taskctl issue archive ID [--thread-id ID] [--if-version N] [--json]
taskctl issue restore ID [--thread-id ID] [--if-version N] [--json]
```

Use `issue move` to set `in_progress` before implementation and `in_review` after implementation and self-verification. Codex must not move work directly from `in_progress` to `done`; use `done` only after the user explicitly confirms acceptance or explicitly asks to mark the issue complete. Use `blocked` when work cannot continue and `canceled` when it will not continue. On a version conflict, fetch the issue again and reconcile before retrying.

Use either `--git-branch` or `--worktree-path`/`--worktree-branch`; an issue has only one development context. Issue JSON stores it as `developmentContext`, either `{ "type": "branch", "branch": "..." }` or `{ "type": "worktree", "path": "...", "branch": "..." }`. Its singular `threadId` is the Codex conversation that most recently created or changed the issue itself. Recurrence requires a due date.

Changing only `--project` preserves the issue's existing linked conversation.

## Issue relations

Read the anchor issue immediately before adding or removing a relation and use its current version. Relation writes require Codex conversation attribution like every other issue write.

```bash
taskctl issue relation add ISSUE_ID \
  --type parent \
  --issue PARENT_ISSUE_ID \
  [--thread-id ID] \
  [--if-version N] \
  [--json]

taskctl issue relation add ISSUE_ID \
  --type blocks|blocked_by|related \
  --issue RELATED_ISSUE_ID \
  [--thread-id ID] \
  [--if-version N] \
  [--json]

taskctl issue relation remove ISSUE_ID \
  --type parent|blocks|blocked_by|related \
  --issue RELATED_ISSUE_ID \
  [--thread-id ID] \
  [--if-version N] \
  [--json]
```

For `--type parent`, `ISSUE_ID` is the child and `PARENT_ISSUE_ID` is its parent. Adding another parent replaces the child's current parent atomically. To add an existing issue as a sub-issue, anchor the command on the child and pass the exact parent identifier with `--issue PARENT_ISSUE_ID`.

For `blocks`, the anchor issue blocks the related issue. For `blocked_by`, the related issue blocks the anchor. `related` is symmetric. Self-relations, duplicates, parent cycles, and relations between different projects are rejected.

## Issue comments

Use the issue id to read or append comments. Comment updates and deletes require the latest comment `version` returned by `comment list`.

```bash
taskctl comment list ISSUE_ID [--json]
taskctl comment add ISSUE_ID --body TEXT [--thread-id ID] [--json]
taskctl comment update COMMENT_ID --body TEXT --if-version N [--thread-id ID] [--json]
taskctl comment delete COMMENT_ID --if-version N [--thread-id ID] [--json]
```

Each comment JSON object independently records the most recent conversation that created or changed that comment as `threadId`. Comment operations never change the parent issue's `threadId`.

## Attachments

Issue descriptions and comments may contain inline images at exact positions in their Markdown:

```markdown
![alt text](api/attachments/ATTACHMENT_ID/content)
```

Upload a local file to a task or a comment. Provide exactly one of `--task` or `--comment`:

```bash
taskctl attachment upload --task TASK_ID --file PATH [--content-type TYPE] [--kind inline|attachment] [--json]
taskctl attachment upload --comment COMMENT_ID --file PATH [--content-type TYPE] [--kind inline|attachment] [--json]
```

The command sends the file bytes to:

- `POST /api/tasks/:id/attachments`, or
- `POST /api/comments/:id/attachments`

with the same headers as the web UI (`Content-Type`, `X-Taskboard-Filename`, `X-Taskboard-Attachment-Kind`). If `--content-type` is omitted, the CLI guesses from the file extension and falls back to `application/octet-stream`. If `--kind` is omitted, images use `inline` and other files use `attachment`. Use `--kind attachment` for an image that must appear in the attachment list. An inline upload returns the attachment id; use that id in the task description or comment Markdown at the required position.

Download an attachment to an explicit local path:

```bash
taskctl attachment download ATTACHMENT_ID --output PATH [--json]
```

The command writes the response body as binary data and returns the absolute output path, content type, and size in its JSON result. Choose the output filename yourself; `taskctl` does not infer or append an extension.
